# Number-Guessing-Game-in-Python

A simple Python-based number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The program provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Random module (for generating random numbers)
- Basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and error handling

# Game Rules:
- The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
- You have 10 attempts to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low.
- If you guess the correct number, you win! If you run out of attempts, the game ends, and the secret number is revealed.
